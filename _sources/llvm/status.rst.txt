czz-llvm is currently a research prototype; it is unsuitable for fuzzing
realistic targets. To expand its reach to more targets, czz-llvm would need at
least:

- `More models of library functions (overrides)
  <https://github.com/langston-barrett/czz/issues/26>`_
- `Benchmarks <https://github.com/langston-barrett/czz/issues/46>`_ and other
  evaluations
- `Evaluation of mutation effectiveness
  <https://github.com/langston-barrett/czz/issues/34>`_
